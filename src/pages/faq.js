We do not spray down our foam with toxic chemicals which increase the life span of the mattress being compressed.  This is common with mattresses shipped compressed from overseas because their journey from warehouse to consumer could be as long as 2 years.  At Chirofoam we use the best quality foams and avoid using unnecessary chemicals in order for our customers to enjoy the best quality healthy sleep.</p>
