						<p className="filson-pro-reg color-secondary pt-5 text-1">You have up to 100 nights to try the Chirofoam™ Memory Foam Mattress in your home to decide if it is the best mattress you have ever slept on.  The sleep trial starts from the day you receive your mattress and ends on the 101st day.  If for some reason you are not completely satisfied with the mattress, you may return the mattress to receive 100% of your money back.</p>
						<p className="filson-pro-reg color-secondary pt-5 text-1">Please note that you cannot return your mattress within the first 21 nights, in order to let your body get adjusted to the mattress. The National Sleep Association suggests that people usually take about 21 days to get adjusted to their new mattress.  Since you have been sleeping on your old mattress for many years, your body will take some time to get adjusted and start to feel better on the Chirofoam™ mattress.</p>
